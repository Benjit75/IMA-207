# IMA-207: Coherent imaging, source separation, remote sensing and industrial applications
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-201 at Télécom Paris

This course is structured in two parts.
The first part deals with new concepts in the Image track (such as coherent imaging and multiplicative noise, source separation,...) using remote sensing applications as a guideline (SAR imagery - synthetic aperture radar -, multi-spectral optical imagery, hyper-spectral imagery). The courses are illustrated by numerous practical works on notebook jupyter.
The other part of the course focuses on industrial applications of image processing and analysis with presentations given by speakers from different companies on the following topics (as an indication): biometrics, photography, non-destructive testing, autonomous vehicle,...
